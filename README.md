# 👩🏻‍💻Object Oriented Programming Exercises 

This exercise list provides practical examples focused on advanced object-oriented programming concepts, including abstract classes, interfaces, and polymorphism. Participants will create a public transportation system using abstract classes, design payment methods through interfaces, simulate a zoo with polymorphic animal behaviors, and develop a hospital staff management system utilizing both abstract classes and interfaces. These exercises aim to deepen understanding and application of these key programming paradigms.
